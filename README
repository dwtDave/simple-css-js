# DBYW - A WordPress Asset Management Plugin

**DBYW** is a WordPress plugin designed specifically for managing JavaScript and CSS files

## Description

This plugin checks for a manifest file in its `assets/dist` directory. This manifest file is presumed to contain paths for the plugin's main JavaScript and CSS files. Once identified, these files are enqueued for use on the WordPress frontend, ensuring your site has the necessary styles and scripts loaded.

## Installation

1. Upload the `dbyw` directory to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the **DBYW** plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. The plugin automatically manages the assets for you; no further configuration is required.

## Features

* Automated asset management: Checks for and loads main CSS and JS files from the `assets/dist` directory.
* Uses a manifest file for identifying the correct assets to enqueue.
* Provides activation and deactivation hooks to manage rewrite rules.

## Usage

Simply activate the plugin, and it will automatically enqueue the required CSS and JS files for your website based on the manifest file present in the `assets/dist` directory.
